						<p>In this project, I collected a year's worth of physical tax returns and entered the data into a table in Google Sheets. I recorded the name of each organization involved in the transactions, the amount in Rand, and the type of purchase. After entering all the amounts, I meticulously reviewed the data to identify and correct any entry errors. Finally, I created a formula to verify the accuracy of the final amount.</p>
