				<p>This project involves the systematic collection and analysis of data regarding the efficacy of local herbs in treating minor ailments, utilizing Google Sheets for data management. Due to the need for precise and reliable data, the research necessitates extensive investigation into herbal medicines. Specific inclusion criteria for participants are: adults residing in Western countries with no severe pre-existing conditions, such as HIV or diabetes.</p>
				<!--<p>In this project we research and input data about the effectiveness of local herbs on minor ailments using Google Sheets. It requires quite a bit of medical research due to limitations placed to ensure the data is accurate and concise. Some of these limitations involve the participants only being adults, residing in Western countries and having no serious pre-existing conditions such as HIV or diabetes.</p> -->
				<p>The research process involved entering the name of the minor ailment followed by the term, "herbal medicine" into Google Scholar. I verified that the study was conducted on adults and pertained to Western herbal medicine. Upon meeting these criteria, I reviewed the results or conclusion section to ensure the herbal medicine demonstrated a definitive effect on the ailment. If an article was behind a paywall, I accessed the excerpt using the DOI through an alternative website. Finally, I meticulously entered the findings into the herbal research spreadsheet.</p>
				<!--<p>Researching involved typing the name of the minor ailment, followed by the words "herbal medicine", into Google Scholar. I would check that the website is of Western herbal medicine and done on adults and once it meets those criteria, I scan to make sure the herbal medicine had a definite effect on the minor ailment, normally by means of a results or conclusion section. If the article is stuck behind a paywall, I would copy and paste the DOI into a website that can view the excerpt. Finally, I neatly input the research into the herbal research spreadsheet.</p>-->
